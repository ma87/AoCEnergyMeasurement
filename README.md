# Advent of Code
Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill
levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who
wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code.
Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a
theme.
