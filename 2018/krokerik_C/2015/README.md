My solutions to Advent of Code, primarily solved in Java, sometimes Clojure if I have the time.

_Advent of Code_ is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.
